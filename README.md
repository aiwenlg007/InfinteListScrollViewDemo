Description
=================
A component that runs on top of NGUI's UIScrollView & UITable classes for Unity3D (i.e. It requires NGUI &amp; Unity3D) can be used with dynamic data.

Instead of instantiating a Prefab for each row in the list we are instantiating a fixed pool of objects that will be 
reused according to the scroll direction.

Best suited for Mobile (tested on both iOS & Android).

Features
============

* Infinite scrolling with clipping panel
* **Only fixed height cells are supported for now**
* Basic Scroll indicator
* Quick jump (selecting a start point)
* Simple sections implementation **(section height need to be equal to the item height)**
* Click item callbacks
* **Tested on Unity v4.2.2 & Unity v4.3 and NGUI v3.0.9f7**


The Demo
============
This demo package requires both Unity3D <http://unity3d.com> and NGUI <http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140> to be installed.
video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xFVJqzp0kY>

To run the demo:

1. Create a new Unity Project (preferably mobile i.e. iOS or Android)
2. Import NGUI **including its examples** as the demo uses the atlas's from the examples
3. Import InfiniteListDemo folder or simply double click on InfiniteListDemoPackage
4. Run the scene (InfiniteListDemo)

Main Classes & Methods in the Demo
===========
===
##InfiniteListPopulator 
The main controller script that can be attached to a gameobject (e.g. the panel)

Some of the main methods included:

====
Initializes the list (also can be called to refresh the list with new data)

	public void InitTableView(ArrayList inDataList, List<int> inSectionsIndices, int inStartIndex)


Parameters:

* inDataList: the generic list of our data (you can change it to any type you wantâ€¦ just make sure to change the member variables types for dataList & OriginalData)* inNumberOfSections: number of sections (int)
* inSectionIndices: List of integers. The start index of each section (not as fancy as indexpath in iOS but did the job for me)
* inStartIndex: where to start

===
Refresh the list without changing the data (list start at startIndex value)

	public void RefreshTableView()

===
Individual methods for changing the parameters if needed


	public void SetStartIndex(int inStartIndex)
	public void SetOriginalData(ArrayList inDataList)
	public void SetSectionIndices(List<int> inSectionsIndices)


===
You can include section titles values.. or if you have more detailed sections seperators you can change the implementation of PopulateListSectionWithIndex

	string GetTitleForSection(int i)
	void PopulateListSectionWithIndex(Transform item, int index)



====
You can do your implementation of what to populate your row item with (in the demo we simply set a label to string value from our datalist array). Simply change InfiniteItemBehaviour (mentioned later below) to include more items as you want.

	void PopulateListItemWithIndex(Transform item, int dataIndex)

===	
Events that can be listened to.

	public event InfiniteItemIsPressed InfiniteItemIsPressedEvent;
	public event InfiniteItemIsClicked InfiniteItemIsClickedEvent;

====

##InfiniteItemBehaviour and InfiniteSectionBehaviour
Scripts attached to the row item prefab & section prefab **(Note: the item prefab need to be tagged as "listItem" and the section prefab as "listSection")** 

Both checks for the visiblity of the item when the list start scrolling and notifiy the InfiniteListPopulator when the items becomes invisible. you can change use them as a template and include more labels, sprites or textures.
